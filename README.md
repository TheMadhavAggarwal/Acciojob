How to best use InterviewBit for acing Tech Interviews and DSA Preparation

 In this article of Accio Tech Tip, we will get into the deeper insights of many useful resources and understand their best use for acing your tech interviews as well as Data Structures and Algorithms preparation. All of us are told repeatedly by our seniors and batchmates that DSA is one of the most important topics that we should know while appearing for tech interviews. But there are fewer people to guide students by providing curated resources for preparation.

Have you ever imagined if there exists a solution that contains answers to all your doubts related to tech interviews and exactly which questions to target before appearing in any tech interview? Well, there exist many such solutions and InterviewBit is one of them. It is categorized as one of the most useful resources for DSA preparation as well as for tech interviews. You can easily access this platform Here

We shall be discussing three major aspects - Data Structures and Algorithms, Computer Science fundamentals, and Tech interviews in a detailed manner to know the best practices that must be followed and extract the most of this platform. 




Data Structures and Algorithms

Coming to the first aspect, Data Structures and Algorithms is an integral part of any tech company's selection process and one has to have good knowledge of the same, to excel in the coding rounds as it is the first step of the selection process and the coding questions are of varying difficulty. But how to make InterviewBit best suit you individually? Don't worry we are here to solve this for you. There are multiple stages of interview preparation, so the most optimal mechanism to boost your trajectory is to identify and take measures tailored for each stage respectively. The three major stages of interview preparation are:

Beginners - You can go with this approach if you are in the early stages of your preparation and have enough time before the commencement of tech interviews and coding rounds. The best approach would be to try all the questions while moving topic-wise and trying various possible approaches for a given question to gain a better understanding. 

This is a very good approach to make a strong base and get your basics crystal clear, benefitting you in the future. Revision is an important part of DSA preparation. As a beginner, you should revisit the previous topics to get a better overall grasp of the DSA concepts. You can complete all the DSA levels in around 3 months if you are regular and consistent.

Intermediary - This is one of the best approaches to follow if you have 2-3 months left before the commencement of your tech interviews and coding rounds. Since you don't have a longer time to solve all the questions and prepare for interviews and coding tests, a good approach can be to spend some time on a question and do the necessary brainstorming. If you are still not able to develop a strategy for the solution, just jump to the hints. Exploring hints and using them, not only helps you catch more hints quickly during your interview but also increases your question-solving speed. 

In case you find it difficult to solve even after hints, just jump to the solution and understand the best approach to solve the question. This will increase your speed and help you think in a more structured manner for the upcoming questions. This approach can help you finish all the levels of DSA in less than 2 months while making sure that you utilize the resources available to you in the best way possible. 

3. Late learners - If you only have a month left and there is still a lot to be covered, this is exactly for you. One of the best approaches at this time would be to attempt approximately 30% of top questions from each topic which were asked by a maximum number of companies in the past years. Each question has a list of company tags representing the companies that had asked the corresponding questions earlier. You could consider referring to the questions with the maximum number of tags. 

This not only increases the probability of attempting the most relevant questions but also allows you to explore all the topics. Since there is not much time left until your interviews, it is essential to revisit the previous topics, since revision is an equally crucial factor during the final days of your preparation.




Computer Science fundamentals

Apart from DSA which is repetitively asked in a tech interview, another important topic is ‘Computer Science’ fundamentals. The resources available for CS fundamentals at InterviewBit are better compared to geeksforgeeks since they cover almost all the aspects of a tech interview and are quite structured. It includes topics such as Database Management System, Object-Oriented Programming, Operating System, and Computer Networks. 

It is a good strategy to study CS fundamentals around a month before your interviews since they are mostly theoretical and won't take more than 2 weeks to be covered. But It is not recommended to leave many topics for the end as it may become hectic and difficult to cover greater portions all at once. InterviewBit has the resources for each of these topics wherein you can go through many previously asked interview questions. All these are the basic questions that one should know while appearing for a tech interview.






Mock Interviews

Now let's move on to the final aspect, The Tech Interviews. If you have been consistently solving DSA questions for around 3 - 4 weeks and believe that you have a good grip on the topics, you can try the mock interview feature of InterviewBit. You can connect with your batchmates or seniors and practice an interview which would help you gain valuable feedback. You can choose any topic of your choice around which you want the interview to revolve. 

Interviewbit provides two options for a mock interview where either you can take the interview at the present moment or schedule it for later. InterviewBit will search for another student that is currently online, looking for a mock interview exactly like you, and will pair you both for a 1 hour 30 minutes long interview. In each turn, one would be the candidate and the other one would be an interviewer. After 45 minutes of a single session, the roles will be reversed to establish a new session of 45 minutes, making a total of 1 hour 30 minutes. This is a very useful approach since both you and your peer can discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each other and work on them to prepare yourself better for a real tech interview.



Having discussed all of these features, InterviewBit can be used to great advantage to step up one’s skill set and prepare in a much more structured format. Although, One of the shortcomings of this platform is the lack of good quality practice contests. Hence our upcoming blogs would also focus on providing information about many such platforms, to make your DSA preparation smooth and steady. So go check it out before the time runs out!
